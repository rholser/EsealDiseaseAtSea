Code associated with analysis of movement and foraging success of a northern elephant seal that was ill compared with typical individuals (other post-breeding adult female northern elephant seals).

Data are publicly available through Dryad respositories https://doi.org/10.7291/D1W101 and https://doi.org/10.7291/D18D7W and the Arctic Data archive System of the National Institute of Polar Research (https://ads.nipr.ac.jp/dataset/A20210316-001). 

Scripts were written in both R and MATLAB to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Calculate mean and standard deviation of various foraging success metrics such as mass gain <--R
2. Calculate surface area to volume ratios from morphometric measurements <--R
3. Calculate daily metrics from jaw motion data <--R
4. Calculate daily and full-trip diving statistics (dive duration, depth, post-dive-interval, etc.) divided by day and night <--MATLAB
5. Generate plots illustrating the various metrics calculated <--R and MATLAB
